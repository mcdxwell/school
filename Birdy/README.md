## Flappy Bird-like Game

This assignment took me 30 to 40 minutes to complete if I remember correctly.
The gravity component and the bird animation gave me the most trouble. This assignment
along with some in-class assignments taught me how game developers create depth with
layers. With multiple layers moving across the screen at varying speeds, it creates a 
sense of depth. This is known as the parallax effect/parallax scrolling. Think about your
periphery while on a long open road; objects at a distance are visible for a longer 
period of time.
