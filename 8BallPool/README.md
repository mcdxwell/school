## Requirements given by my professor:
----

> Below are specific requirements of the game:
> 
> - When the game starts, all solid and stripe balls must appear in a triangle > shape, and the cue ball (white) must appear in its default position (on center > of the white line) as shown in the above picture.
>   
> - The player should be able to move the cue (stick) around the cue ball by > moving the mouse around it.
>   
> - The player should be able to move the cue backward by pressing on the space bar. 
>   
> - The longer he/she holds the space bar, the farther it moves back until it > reaches a predefined maximum point. Beyond that point, the cue will not move any > further even if the player continues to hold the space bar.
>   
> - The player can hit the cue ball with the cue by releasing the space bar. The 
> velocity with which the cue hits the ball will depend on how far the cue is > moved back before releasing the space bar. 
> 
> - Configure the physics on game objects in such a way that the movement and 
> collision of the balls feel as close as possible to the real-world game.
> 
> - Just like in real world pool game, whenever a ball meets one of the holes, it > must be removed from the scene.
> 
> - Since this is a practice game, the user can target and hit any of the > remaining balls on the table.
> 
> - If the cue ball falls in the hole, position it back at its default position, i.> e. on center of the white line
> 
> - After all the balls on the table are cleared (except the cue ball), > automatically restart the game.
